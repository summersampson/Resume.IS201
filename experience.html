                                                    My main jobs were to help people that were looking for their animals, dropping off donations, or looking to adopt new animals. I also worked directly with the animals, cleaning and caring from them. I was also able to do behavioral checks on animals that were going out for adoption, as well as vaccinate and microchip scan the animals. Because the animals were often feral, this experience taught me how to work calmly in a high-pressure environment, and how to help people in distress.

                                                    Eterna is a permanent jewelry business, meaning that I welded jewelry directly around the customer. This job taught me a lot about welding, as well as how to work with people and make sure that customers are safe and happy with their products. Because I started this job when it was opening for the first time, I was able to help to shape the business into a fully functional operation.

                                                    At Valore, I made jewelry with gems and metal. I also taught classes of 2-8 people, helping them make their own jewelry. Leading the classes took 1.5-6 hours and demanded that I be focused and able to teach people simply and clearly. This was a super good job for me because I loved being able to work with others and get to know the customers. It was super important that everything was done perfectly because if their piece got messed up then they could have lost hundreds of dollars and I would need to redo the project.

                                                    For this job, I cleaned an Airbnb multiple times a week. It was a 9-room house with 5 beds. I had to work quickly and efficiently because often one group would check out and that same night a new group would come in. Being an independent worker taught me how to manage myself, stay productive, and track my own work.

My tasks included taking orders, preparing drinks, cookies, and popcorn, and cleaning. As a Shift Lead, I was in charge of assigning the other people working with specific jobs, making decisions as acting managers,  and checking workers off when they wanted to go home. I loved being able to develop sales skills, such as upselling the products. Through being a Shift Lead, I learned how to manage others in a successful way.

I learned a lot about the importance of being confident and professional while working with people. At Yogurtland I also prepared food and cleaned the store. This taught me the importance of being precise and working quickly.

                            I was able to volunteer at the Community Action and Food Bank as well as the Food and Care Coalition Center. With these two places, I prepared food and served it to people in low-no income situations, stalked food that people could receive for free, and provided other resources to those that qualified for them.

                            This last year, I was able to volunteer at the Children’s Justice Center (CJC). This is a center where kids that have been abused are able to meet with law enforcement and counselors to get help. They would have volunteers come in to play with the kids while their parents talked to a support team.

                                For my Social Impact class, I was able to write a publish an issue brief looking at sexual assault specifically for women in the US. I was able to meet with a professional and gather information from multiple places. This project helped me not only learn more about how timely this issue is, but I also gained a lot of research skills.

I then planned where the food should be collected and where it should be taken. It was super cool to work with people to do something so fun and festive.
